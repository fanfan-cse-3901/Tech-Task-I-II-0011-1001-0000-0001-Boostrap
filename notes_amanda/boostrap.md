Starting Bootstrap:
You need to link Bootstrap's CSS and JS files. It requires a containing element for its elements and grid system. 
The Bootstrap containers can be fixed or fluid. A fixed container has a fixed width. If the browser is resized, 
its width will remain the same until at some threshold and shrink to its next width. On the other hand, a fluid
container spans the full width of viewport, with it constantly changing to fit the browser.
