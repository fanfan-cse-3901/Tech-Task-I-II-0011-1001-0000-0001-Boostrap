### Audience

* Web Designer
* Web Developer
* Programmer

### Don't Repeat Yourself (Write DRY Code)

Most web developers were asked to implement different web pages with similar objects over time. It is frustrating because most of them were just moving codes from the previous project to the existing project and debugging.

During the migration, developers need to identify both HTML and CSS for the element they want over and over again.

### Solutions: Bootstrap

* CSS
  * Responsive design
  * Component
* JavaScript
* Precompiled Version
  * Some popular JavaScript/CSS libraries, such as jQuery, are very common on the Internet. When a user is browsing one of the pages, it is very likely that he/she has already visited some other websites with the same jQuery library. Since the user's browser has been cached (if there is a cache with the same location of the same source, the browser will use the cache file directly, and will not load it again), therefore, it will indirectly increase the speed of visiting the website.

## Introduction to Bootstrap:

Bootstrap is a front-end framework for creating web applications.
Websites made from Bootstrap automatically scale between devices of all sizes, though it is primarily designed mobile devices ("mobile-first").
Bootstrap has a standard set of classes that allow developers to quickly create applications and use common components.

The Advantages of using Bootstrap include:
 - an easier and faster framework for web-development
 - the web-pages are platform-independent
 - compatible with modern web browsers
 - the web-pages are responsive
 - the design is consistent where Bootstrap components have a centralized library 
 - easy to use: just need basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript
 - open-source, free tool collection

Basic Features of Bootstrap framework:
 - Grid System
 - Typography Styling Mechanism
 - Form styling methods
 - Techniques of styling common user interface elements

Advanced Features of Bootstrap framework:
 - Modal Window
 - Dynamic Tabs
 - Tooltips
 - Arlets
 - Accordian menu
 - Carousel
 - Scrollspy


Starting Bootstrap:
You need to link Bootstrap's CSS and JS files. It requires a containing element for its elements and grid system. 
The Bootstrap containers can be fixed or fluid. A fixed container has a fixed width. If the browser is resized, 
its width will remain the same until at some threshold and shrink to its next width. On the other hand, a fluid
container spans the full width of viewport, with it constantly changing to fit the browser.
